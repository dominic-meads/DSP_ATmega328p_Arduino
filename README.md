# DSP_ATmega328p_Arduino
Some DSP on an ATmega328p using Atmel studio (C), and Arduino (Arduino Code). Maybe a youtube video will come out of it

The "Test_and_prototype" folder was developed using C and MATLAB, a rough draft of a low pass FIR filter was coded in C. Its filter coefficients and calculations were checked using MATLAB with the compare file. 

The "Final" folder is where the actual embedded C program lies. Additionally, there is a MATLAB file showing the interpolations of the output signal. The data for the MATLAB file was taken with a logic analyzer attatched to the ATmega328p chip running the embedded C code written in Atmel Studio 7.
